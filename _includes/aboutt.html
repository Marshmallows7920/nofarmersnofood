                    <br /><br />On September 20, 2020,<br /><br /> Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to the bills as a watershed moment in the history of Indian agriculture and stated the bills will <em>“ensure a complete transformation of the agriculture sector”</em> and empower tens of millions of farmers. <em>“Farm bills and labour bills are very important steps in the right direction. They have the potential to have more labour market flexibility, providing greater social security to workers and more formalization of the labour market. In the case of agriculture, having a much more integrated market, creating competition, having farmers getting a greater share of the price that finally the retail price that’s paid. So that helps with rural incomes.” </em><sup><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-says-passing-of-key-farm-bills-in-parliament-watershed-moment-in-history-of-indian-agriculture-2298307">source</a></sup></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">The Ordinance was passed in Rajya Sabha by a voice vote, which was stated as questionable and unparliamentary by many for such a critical bill. <sup><a href="https://scroll.in/article/973588/use-of-a-dubious-voice-vote-to-pass-critical-farm-bills-severely-dents-indian-democracy">source</a></sup></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Ever since the three bills were brought into question, several farmer unions and organisations from the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, and many others have been openly critical and protesting the three monstrous bills, stating that <em>“the recent laws enacted at the Centre will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system. Over time big corporate houses will dictate terms and farmers will end up getting less for their crops, they argue. Farmers fear that with the virtual disbanding of the mandi system, they will not get an assured price for their crops and the ’arthiyas’ —commission agents who also pitch in with loans for them — will be out of business.” </em><sup><a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/what-farmers-want-and-why-they-are-protesting-11611662903629.html">source</a></sup><br /> However, the union government of ‘world’s largest democracy’ is unwilling to be considerate about its people who are pertaining to an industry which employs 54.6% of the Indian working population.</p>
